## credit-risk-classification

## Overview:
Various techniques were used to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company was used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Results: 
- Logistic Regression Model with Original Data

The Logistic Regression model predicted well healthy loans with 100% precision and recall. It does less well at isolating high-risk loans with precision of 87% and 89% recall.

- Logistic Regression Model with Over Sampling Data

The logistic regression model predicts the oversampled data with precision and recall of 99%.  It does well!  It did better than the original data model.
